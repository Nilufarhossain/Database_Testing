# IDSDP_Staging_License_Database_Testing
This database was tested on test data from the License module IDSDP_MOST staging server. While my office did not require this, I conducted the test to better understand how relational database management works in real-life servers.

## List of Database Testing Performed 
- DML testing
- Database schema testing
- Stroed Procedure Testing
- Trigger Testing
  
## Environment 
I tested this MySQL database on phpMyAdmin localhost. To run this project on phpMyAdmin, XAMPP needs to be installed on the PC.

## Lessons Learned
I have always been interested in database management. This project has further increased my interest. In the future, I plan on testing functions and the ACID properties of databases.
